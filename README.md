## Overview
Welcome to the Remote Shell Project! This project consists of two main components: a **server-side script** and a **client-side script**.

These scripts are designed for **educational purposes only** and provide the ability to establish a remote shell connection with a target machine, allowing for 
**command execution**, **file operations**, and a **keylogger feature**.

**As a junior ethical hacker**, I'm sharing this project with the community to learn and collaborate together.
