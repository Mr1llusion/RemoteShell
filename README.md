## Overview
Welcome to the Remote Shell Project! This project consists of two main components: a *server-side script* and a *client-side script*.

These scripts are designed for *educational purposes only* and provide the ability to establish a remote shell connection with a target machine, allowing for 
`command execution`, `file operations`, and a `keylogger feature`.

**As a junior ethical hacker**, I'm sharing this project with the community to learn and collaborate together.
