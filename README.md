## Overview

Welcome to the Remote Shell Project! This project consists of two main components: a server-side script and a client-side script. These scripts are designed for educational and ethical hacking purposes and provide the ability to establish a remote shell connection with a target machine, allowing for command execution, file operations, and even includes a keylogger feature.

**As a junior ethical hacker**, I'm sharing this project with the community to learn and collaborate together.


## Project Status

Please note that this project is a work in progress. I continuously working on improving and expanding its capabilities. Feel free to contribute or keep an eye on this repository for updates and enhancements.

## Usage

To use the Remote Shell Project, you'll need to set up the server and client components with appropriate configurations. Detailed instructions and usage guides can be found in the project's documentation.
`pynput.keyboard`: This library is not built-in and needs to be installed separately.
